# Overview

The Flutter Todo List application is a minimalist mobile app designed to streamline task management. The application allows users to create, modify, and delete tasks. The tasks are displayed in a simplistic list view, and each task has an accompanying checkbox to mark completion.

As a software engineer, I am continually seeking to create solutions to everyday problems. My motivation for creating this application was to enhance personal productivity. Managing tasks efficiently is essential for all individuals, and I wanted to create a straightforward yet robust tool to assist with this.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I developed this app using the following tools:

Flutter SDK
Dart programming language
Visual Studio Code

Flutter, a UI toolkit from Google, is used to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. The Dart programming language, which is easy to understand for JavaScript or Java developers, powers Flutter. For the development environment, I chose Visual Studio Code because of its excellent support for Flutter and Dart.

# Future Work

* In the future, I will add the ability to categorize tasks into separate folders or tabs
* I will also implement notifications for when tasks are due
* Finally, I would like to have the program be able to sync across multiple devices
